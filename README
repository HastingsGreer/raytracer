To compile and run, execute the shell script "assignment1.sh"

part 1 will be written to "part1.ppm"
part 2 will be written to "part2.ppm"
part 3 will be written to "part3.ppm"

some shenanigans I've been working on will be written to "teapotproblems.ppm"


./src/ contains all the c++ source files:
    
    AABB, Vector3, Matrix3, Color, and Ray are datatypes used throughout 
    to encapsulate coordinate by coodinate calculations
    
    Renderable is an abstract class that computes lighting based on a normal, 
    an intersection position, and a Phong profile. Subclasses are responsible 
    for implementing intersection and normal vector calculation
    
    Triangle, Plane, Sphere, and VolumeHigharchy implement Renderable
    
    Canvas contains an aray of pixels and knows how to write itself to a ppm
    
    Camera contains information about its position and knows how to turn pixel 
    coordinates into rays in 3-space
    
    Room stores references to the lights and Renderables in the scene, is 
    responsible for checking intersection queries against its list of 
    Renderables, and traces each ray yielded by the camera and stores the 
    results to a Canvas
    
    
./stl/ contains teapot data
